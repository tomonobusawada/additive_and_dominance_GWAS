# additive and dominance GWAS
This repository contains scripts for joint association testing for additive and dominance genetic effects. The provided simulated genotype data will be used as an input.

- Simulated genotypes
LD structure was simulated AR(1).
The resulting additive and domiancne genotypes are mutually uncorrelated.
- Association test
